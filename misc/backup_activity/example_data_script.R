## Experimentn with example data


## Read in data
ex_data <- readRDS("./misc/backup_activity/example_data.RDS")


## Things to do with the data
# 1. What is the usual interval between detections?
# 2. Are there daily patterns in the detection times?
# 3. Calculate the distance between detections. What could you explore in relation to the distance traveled?
# 4. Make a map of the detections. Add satellite imagery to this map. 
# 5. Try other visualizations from yesterday's tutorial, such as animations.
# 6. Use other tools from yesterday
